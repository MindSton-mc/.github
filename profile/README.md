# About MultivetisMc.

## Introduction:

Since 2021, MultivetisMc has been **developing a Minecraft server** for the latest version of the game. We are a determined team and we love open source. We currently do not know **when the server will be released** but we are working on our plugins on which you can contribute or fork, all our plugin projects are under the **GPL 3.0 license** better known as the **GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE 3.0**. Our launcher is **not yet in development**!

## Who are we?

MultivetisMc is a company developing a **Minecraft server** and a **Minecraft launcher** founded in 2021 by **Peperehobbits01** with the desire to create something **new for Minecraft** and not just another Skyblock server or mini-games which are **overdone**. The project started from scratch but now **certain parts of its software** are licensed **GPL-3.0** to allow you to contribute to the project which currently has **no scheduled release date**.

## What are our goals?

We aim to offer a **new experience** in the world of Minecraft for players and enable a **combination of all communities into a single launcher** but also to combat **pay-to-win** on Minecraft servers.

## How to contribute to the project?

To contribute to the project, please **read and follow the installation instructions in the readme of the repository** you want to contribute to, then **read the CONTRIBUTING.md of the repository** located in the **.github folder**. This helps to maintain a good working atmosphere and minimizes surprises in the code during development.
