# About MindSton.

## Introduction:

Since 2021, MindSton has been **developing a Minecraft server** for the latest version of the game. We are a determined team and we love open source. We currently do not know **when the server will be released** but we are working on our Fabric mods/Minestom extentions on which you can contribute or fork, all our projects are under the **MIT License** or others if it's a fork of a other project. Our launcher is **not yet in development** but will start to be in developement **pretty soon**, at list we hope!

## Who are we?

MindSton is a company developing a **Minecraft server** and a **Minecraft launcher**, founded in 2021 by **Peperehobbits01** in Belgium, with the desire to create something **new for Minecraft** and not just another Skyblock server or mini-games which are **overdone**. The project started from scratch but now **certain parts of its software** are licensed **MIT or other licenses** to allow you to contribute to the project which currently has **no scheduled release date**.

## What are our goals?

We aim to offer a **new experience** in the world of Minecraft for players and enable a **combination of all communities into a single launcher** but also to combat **pay-to-win** on Minecraft servers and contribuiting to the **Minecraft servers of the future**, and giving to the childs palying Minecraft, **a experience as good as we got when we where kids**.

## How to contribute to the project?

To contribute to the project, please **read and follow the installation instructions in the readme of the repository** you want to contribute to, then **read the CONTRIBUTING.md of the repository and the Code Of Conduct** located in the **.github folder**. This helps to maintain a good working atmosphere and minimizes surprises in the code during development. If you want to use the software, don't forget too look at the **SECURITY.md of the repositories** of the software you are using. We mostly only support the **latest version for security updates**.
